This is a bot who will translate discord messages when a user react to a message with a specific emoji.
</br>
By default: `abc` (ðŸ”¤)

# How to use ?
_________________

You need first have installed the following dependencies:
    <li>`discord.py`</li>
    <li>`translators`</li>


After that, all you need to do is to launch the `main.py` with the bot's token as parameter.
</br>
**Note:** By default, the token's argument index is `1`. This can differ depending on your configuration / IDE.
</br>
</br>
If you don't want to use arguments to use your token, you can put it directly in the `TOKEN` variable in the `main.py` file.
(make sure to change the client.run() method to `client.run(TOKEN)`)
